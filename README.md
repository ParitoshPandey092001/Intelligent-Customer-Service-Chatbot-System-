This project implements a scalable customer support chatbot capable of:

Understanding user intent using fine-tuned BERT

Answering document-based (PDF) queries using Mistral-7B

Optimizing inference latency and compute efficiency for deployment

The system combines Natural Language Inference (NLI), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and model compression techniques to deliver high-performance conversational AI.
